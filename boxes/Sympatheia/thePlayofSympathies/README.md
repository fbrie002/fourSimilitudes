the Play of Sympathies

This is an initial example of the code for the Sympatheia box, illustrating the attractive and repellant forces that characterize the play of sympathies, as described by Foucault, in The Order of Things. 

The sketch is based on a basic boid-like structure, and resembles the movement of sea anemones with its mesmerising ondulating movement of attraction and separation.  

The simulated forces used to mimic the attraction and repulsion of sympathy and antipathy:
 - force attracting the tentacles to the center 
 - force of friction with the surrounding environment
 - repellant force pushing the heads apart from one another 

By holding the mouse, more heads are added to the sea anemone array, which gradually grows in size and complexity. As the creature grows, the repellant force seems to be pushing the heads further out, away from each other, but they always converge towards the center.

The sketch is in p5.js and uses the standard libraries. It draws upon the Flocking example from The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman.

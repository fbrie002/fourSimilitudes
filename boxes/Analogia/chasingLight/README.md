- Chasing Light -

This is the code for the Analogia box.

Two lights, chasing one another, reverberating and morphing to a soundscape led by the sound of a heart beat. They represent Foucault's analogy between the blood in our veins and the cycles of the stars in the sky.

The sketch is in p5.js and uses the standard libraries. It draws upon this Solar System example by McMike: https://editor.p5js.org/McMike/sketches/9fn_RbQv8
